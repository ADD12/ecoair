Breakdown of Fields
SenML is designed to be compact. You define "Base" values in the first record, and they automatically apply to all subsequent records in the list.
bn (Base Name): A unique identifier for the device (often a MAC address or URN). Because this is a "Base" field, it applies to every measurement in the array.
bt (Base Time): The Unix Epoch timestamp (in seconds) when the measurement was taken.
n (Name): The specific metric being measured (e.g., "pm2.5").
u (Unit): The unit of measure. SenML uses standard unit symbols:
ug/m3 = Micrograms per cubic meter
Cel = Degrees Celsius
%RH = Relative Humidity
v (Value): The actual numeric reading.
Why this helps your Eco Dashboard
Bandwidth Efficiency: You don't have to repeat the Device ID (bn) or Timestamp (bt) for every single sensor reading (PM2.5, Temp, Humidity, etc.), which saves data on cellular/LoRaWAN connections.
Self-Describing: The units (u) are included in the packet. Your dashboard doesn't need to "guess" if the temperature is in Celsius or Fahrenheit—the data explicitly says so.
